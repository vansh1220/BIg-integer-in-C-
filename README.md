# 📦 BigInt – Arbitrary Precision Integer in C++

## 🔢 Overview

`BigInt` is a custom C++ data type that supports operations on arbitrarily large integers.
This implementation supports basic arithmetic, comparisons, and mathematical utilities.

## 🛠️ Features

- Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo
- Power and Square Root
- Comparisons
- Fibonacci, Factorial, Catalan
- Post/Pre Increment/Decrement
- Input/Output Stream Operators

## ▶️ Build Instructions

```
g++ main.cpp BigInt.cpp -o bigint
./bigint
```

## 📌 Sample Output

```
a = 12345
b = 67890
a + b = 80235
a * b = 838102050
...
```

## 📚 Applications

- Large integer computations
- Cryptography, combinatorics
- Competitive programming
